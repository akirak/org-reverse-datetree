* org-reverse-datetree
This library provides a function for creating reverse date trees,
which is similar to date trees supported by `org-capture' but
in a reversed order. This is convenient in situation where
you want to find the latest status of a particular subject
using a search tool like `helm-org-rifle'.

** Usage
=org-reverse-datetree-1= function jumps to today's subtree in an Org buffer. 

The current limitation: An inserted date must be the latest. You cannot insert a date that is older than the latest day in the destination file/buffer.

The format can be customized by setting =org-reversedate-tree-{year,month,date}-format=.

*** Usage in org-capture

You can create an entry in a reverse date tree using the following template:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ("x" "TEMPLATE-NAME" entry (file+function "~/org/YOUR-FILE.org" org-reverse-datetree-1)
   "TEMPLATE-BODY"
   OPTIONS...)
#+END_SRC
