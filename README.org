This package provides functions for creating reverse
date trees, which are similar to date trees created by built-in
functions of Org mode (e.g. =org-capture= and =org-archive=) but in a
reversed order. Since newer contents come first in reverse date trees,
they are more useful in situations where you want to find latest
activities on a particular subject using a search tool like
[[https://github.com/alphapapa/helm-org-rifle][helm-org-rifle]].

** Features
- Reverse date trees, where latest contents are shown first.
- You can customize the format of the date tree.
- Week trees are also supported.
- Configurations of date trees are stored in file headers, so each file is ensured to have a single date tree with a consistent structure.
  Configuration is done interactively on first creation.
** Prerequisites
- Emacs 26.1
- dash
** Usage
The following functions retrieve a configuration from the file header:

- Use =org-reverse-datetree-goto-date-in-file= to jump to a date in the date tree. If this function is called non-interactively and the time argument is nil, it jumps to the current date. This can be used for =org-capture=.
- =org-reverse-datetree-goto-read-date-in-file= is similar as above, but it always prompts for a date even if the function is called non-interactively.
- =org-reverse-datetree-refile-to-file= is a function that refiles the current entry into a date tree. This can be used to build a custom command for refiling an entry to a particular file.
*** Configuring date formats
The format configuration is stored in the file header of each Org file, as shown in the following example:

#+begin_src org
  ,#+REVERSE_DATETREE_DATE_FORMAT: %Y-%m-%d %A
  ,#+REVERSE_DATETREE_WEEK_FORMAT: %Y W%W
  ,#+REVERSE_DATETREE_YEAR_FORMAT: %Y
  ,#+REVERSE_DATETREE_USE_WEEK_TREE: t
#+end_src

These attributes are added by functions in this package on initial creation of the date tree, so you usually don't have to manually edit them.

You can customize the default format by setting
=org-reversedate-tree-{year,month,date}-format=.
Note that the formats should be basically numeric and zero-prefixed, since
date-tree headings are ordered lexicographically by their texts.
You should avoid a month format containing a string like "Feb" or "February".

*** Defining a capture template
You can define an =org-capture= template which inserts an entry into a date tree with [[https://github.com/akirak/org-starter][org-starter]] package as follows:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-starter-def-capture "p"
  "Commonplace book plain entry"
  entry
  (file+function "cpb.org" org-reverse-datetree-goto-date-in-file)
  "* %?"
  :clock-in t :clock-resume t :empty-lines 1)
#+end_src

*** Jumping to a particular date
Use =org-reverse-datetree-goto-date-in-file= command to jump to a particular date in the date tree of the current file.

*** Defining a refile function
With =org-reverse-datetree-refile-to-file=, you can define a function which can be used to refile entries to the date tree in a particular file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun akirak/org-refile-to-cpb (arg)
    (interactive "P")
    (org-reverse-datetree-refile-to-file
     (org-starter-locate-file "cpb.org" nil t) nil
     :ask-always arg :prefer '("CREATED_TIME" "CREATED_AT" "CLOSED")))
#+end_src

The heading properties given as =:prefer= to the function are used to determine the date of an entry.

You can use this function both in =org-mode= (either on a single entry or on multiple entries under selection) and in =org-agenda-mode= (either on a single entry or on bulk entries). It retrieves a date for each entry if it operates on multiple entries.

=org-starter-locate-file= is a function from org-starter package, which locates the location of an Org file. If you don't use the package, you should give an absolute path:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun akirak/org-refile-to-cpb (arg)
    (interactive "P")
    (org-reverse-datetree-refile-to-file
     "~/org/cpb.org" nil
     :ask-always arg :prefer '("CREATED_TIME" "CREATED_AT" "CLOSED")))
#+end_src

A recommended way to invoke this command is to add an entry to =org-starter-extra-refile-map= in org-starter package:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'org-starter-extra-refile-map
               '("p" akirak/org-refile-to-cpb "cpb"))
#+end_src

Then you can run =org-starter-refile-by-key= and press ~p~ key to refile the selected entries to =cpb.org=.
