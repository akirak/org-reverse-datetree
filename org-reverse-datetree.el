;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides a function for creating reverse date trees,
;; which is similar to date trees supported by `org-capture' but
;; in a reversed order.  This is convenient in situation where
;; you want to find the latest status of a particular subject
;; using a search tool like `helm-org-rifle'.
